# How to Use UrbanRebornAI
Welcome to UrbanRebornAI, your AI-powered agent designed to help you discover abandoned or unused places in cities and provide creative ideas for revitalizing these spaces for the community.

   For each location, you will receive:
   - üìç **Name or description of the place**
   - üîé **A brief explanation of why it is abandoned or unused**, with a reliable source linking to the reference (e.g., article, government list).

   - üìå **Google Maps link** to locate the place visually.
